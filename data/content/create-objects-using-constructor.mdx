title: Create Objects using a Constructor
excerpt: Inheritance in JavaScript allows objects to inherit(actually link) to properties and methods of other objects, creating a hierarchical relationship between them.

## Constructors - Functions That Make Objects

Javascript doesn't have any special function that makes them a constructor, the `new` keyword does all the work of making it behave like one. Conventionally, such function names are capitalised.

### Creating Similar Objects

Friend and buddy objects have many similarities in terms of behavior e.g. walk, talk, speak etc. But the data i.e. name, age etc is unique to them. With that, we can create a constructor that creates this unique person with unique data and stores the common behavior in its prototype object.

```js
// constructor
function Person(name) {
  // unique data
  this.name = name
}
// common behavior
Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return 'Hello! I am ' + this.name
}

// create an object with unique data
var friend = new Person('meher')
var buddy = new Person('you')

friend.greet() // > 'Hello! I am meher'
```

## Inheritance Between Constructors

There is no single step in JS that lets you create subclasses because JS was created differently. And subclassing is something that doesn't exist in prototype-based languages but it can simulate one. So we need to do this manually and we need to get the following steps right to achieve the subclassing that exists in class-based languages.

- Inherit instance properties from the superclass
- Inherit prototype properties from the super
- `instanceof` should work correctly for the instance objects

### Setting up the Subclass

The first step is to make the subclass inherit instance properties from the superclass. And we do that by invoking the superclass using the `call` method which executes the super function using the `this` of the subclass. If we used the `new` keyword here instead then we would have just created an instance of the superclass which we don't want.

```js
function AwesomePerson(name, hobby) {
  Person.call(this, name)
  this.hobby = hobby
}
```

### Linking the Subclass and Superclass Prototype

We have already seen how we can link the objects to share common behavior. It's similar to that but we need to note that `Object.create` takes objects as inputs and therefore you would notice that we pass `super.prototype` instead of just `super` as `super is a function.

```js
AwesomePerson.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype)
```

Out of curiosity, we can argue that why can't we do something like the following but the problem is that this returns all the instance properties of the Person too, and for instance, properties we have already configured previously when we did 'Person.call(this, name)'. And when it comes to setting the prototype of `AwesomePerson`, we just need the prototype object of the `Person`.

```js
AwesomePerson.prototype = new Person() // incorrect
```

Now, because we linked the prototype to Person, the constructor property on the
`prototype` on `AwesomePerson` points to `Person`. So we fix that by the following statement.

```js
AwesomePerson.prototype.constructor = AwesomePerson
```

Now, we can go about adding methods to the prototype of our `AwesomePerson` function. Doing it before the `Object.create` step would get them overwritten.

```js
AwesomePerson.prototype.express = function () {
  return 'I love ' + this.hobby
}
```
