There were many options that I tried, I think one with the `currentColor` option but the one that worked seamlessly was this little snippet, you place it right after the SVG tag and it just works.

I also use [Next-Themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) that fully supports dark mode, including system preference with prefers-color-scheme and also immediately syncs this between tabs.

In a gist, the `prefers-color-scheme` is a CSS media feature used to detect the user's preferred color scheme or theme set in their operating system or device settings. Also, you can read more about it in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).

```html
<svg width="351" height="348" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xml:space="preserve" version="1.1">
  <style>
    svg {
      fill: #232323;
      stroke: #444;
    }
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      svg {
        fill: #999888;
        stroke: #fafafa;
      }
    }
  </style>
  <g>
    <title>Layer 1</title>
    <g id="svg_440">
      <path>.....</path>
    </g>
  </g>
</svg>
```
