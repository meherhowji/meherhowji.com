## Overview

It's similar to Merge Sort where we apply a divide and conquer approach but unlike Merge sort there is
no need to combine because Quicksort sorts in place.

## Divide

**Pivot** can be selected by choosing :

- A right-most item in the list.
- A randomly selected value is also taken as a pivot, the random item is then swapped with the last
  item in the list.
- A set of three random values are picked, and the median value among the 3 is swapped with the last
  item in the list.
- Items that are less than the pivot are collected on the left and right if otherwise.
- The above evaluation will not guarantee sorted items on the left or right.

## Conquer

The left and right chunks are repeatedly applied with the same evaluation.

## Combine

No combine is needed, unlike merge sort, because the sorting happens in place.

## Main Method Pseudocode

- function that takes: A (input), p(starting index), r(pivot's index)
  - if p â‰¥ r then do nothing
  - get q(dividing line between the left and right chunk) by partitioning
  - invoke the main method with the left chunk with (A, p, q-1) as parameters
  - invoke the main method with the right chunk with (A, q+1, r) as parameters

## Partition Pseudocode

- function that takes: A(input), p(starting index), r(pivot's index)
  - set q as p
  - loop through the input
    - check if the current value of the input is less than the pivot
    - then swap the current value with the q
  - after the loop, swap the r with the q ( this put the pivot in between the left and right chunks)

## Code

```js
var A = [5, 4, 3, 1, 4, 53, 1, 4, 6, 3, 7, 3, 11, 2, 1, 5, 7, 3]

function quicksort(A, p, r) {
  if (p >= r) return

  var q = partition(A, p, r)
  quicksort(A, p, q - 1)
  quicksort(A, q + 1, r)
}

function partition(A, p, r) {
  var q = p

  for (var u = p; u <= r - 1; u++) {
    if (A[u] <= A[r]) {
      ;[A[q], A[u]] = [A[u], A[q]]
      q++
    }
  }
  ;[A[q], A[r]] = [A[r], A[q]]
  return q
}

quicksort(A, 0, A.length - 1)
console.log(A)
```
