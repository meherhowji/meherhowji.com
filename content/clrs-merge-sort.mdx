title: CLRS Merge Sort in JavaScript
excerpt: Regular Merge Sort and CLRS Merge Sort are essentially the same algorithm, but CLRS Merge Sort is a more specific implementation that follows the algorithm as described in the textbook "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

## Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS Version of Merge Sort

I like this version more than the regular merge sort version because we can see much more clarity
in terms of recursion. Initially, the letters `p, q, r` might look strange but they just denote p
as the 0th index, q as a mid-point index, r as the last index

## Main Function's Pseudocode

- For an input array A[p…r]
- Find the floor mid-point q as (p+q)/2
- mergesort(A, p, q)
- mergesort(A, q+1, r)
- merge(A, p, q, r)

## Merge Function's Pseudocode

In the below pseudocode, setting the B and C as infinity helps us avoid running through the last
remaining array for which we have to write 2 loops in the regular merge sort version. Inserting a
“Sentinel” value, in this case, a value that will be larger than any real value in the array, at the
end of the array will make the check against it always fail. Also, a sentinel value can be thought of
as a value that terminates the loop.

- create B and C as new arrays
- set i and j as 0
- copy A[p..q] to B and A[q+1..r] to C
- set B’s and C’s last item as Infinity
- for k = p to r:
  - if B[i] is less than C[j]
    - set A[k] as B[i] and increment i
  - else if B[i] is more than C[j]
    - set A[k] to C[j] and increment j

## Final Code

```js
var input = [1, 5, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 7, 4, 5, 1, 0, 8, 2, 1, -1, -3]

function mergeSort(A, p, r) {
  if (p >= r) return

  var q = Math.floor((p + r) / 2)
  mergeSort(A, p, q)
  mergeSort(A, q + 1, r)
  merge(A, p, q, r)
}

function merge(A, p, q, r) {
  var B = [],
    C = []
  var i = 0,
    j = 0

  for (var m = p; m <= q; m++) {
    B.push(A[m])
  }

  for (var m = q + 1; m <= r; m++) {
    C.push(A[m])
  }

  B.push(Infinity)
  C.push(Infinity)

  for (var k = p; k <= r; k++) {
    if (B[i] <= C[j]) {
      A[k] = B[i]
      i++
    } else if (B[i] > C[j]) {
      A[k] = C[j]
      j++
    }
  }
}

mergeSort(input, 0, input.length - 1)
console.log(input)
```
